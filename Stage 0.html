<h1>Esther's Notes</h1>
<h3>Self Intro</h3>
<p>Hello there! I'm Esther, taking this course while working full-time. Hope I can keep up with the pace of it! I've taken the CS101 course at Udacity when it had just come out, and it has left me with a lasting impression ever since. I want to understand more about how to code and also obtain the skills to do some fun, little projects for myself too. Anyways, on to my notes!</p>

<h3>Key Ideas</h3>

<b>The Internet</b>
<p>The Internet is the world's largest computer network, and it uses HTTP as its main protocol. Through the Internet, individuals can access files stored on servers through a browser. These servers are essentially computers that are optimised for storing files, and they can store any type of file to be made accessible over the internet. Most of the content that can be found on the internet consists of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML documents can consist of the following:
<ul>
	<li><u>Text content</u>: This is what you see</li>
	<li><u>Markup</u>: This indicates what it looks like</li>
	<li><u>References to other documents</u>: This can be images or videos embedded in the page; it can also be references to CSS style sheets that indicates how the page looks like</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.udacity.com">Links to other pages</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Markup usually consists of an opening and a closing tag (although there are exceptions). An element referrs to an open and close tag plus the content between them.</p>
<p>Elements can be either inline or block. Block elements automatically create a kind of "invisible box" around them, whereas inline elements don't. This means that, unless explicitly stated, inline elements will be displayed on one continues line.</p>
